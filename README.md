## Overview of the Analysis

For this machile learning model, a set of lending data was analyzed that included:

the size of the loan
its interest rate
the borrower's income
the debt to income ratio
the number of accounts the borrower held
derogatory marks against the borrower
the total debt

The dataset was then separated and split into training and testing sets in order to understand the accuracy of the model.  A logistic regression model was implemented using sklearn and fit to our training data to allow us to make predictions on the loans from our lending data.

## Overview of the Analysis

For this machile learning model, a set of lending data was analyzed that included:

The size of the loan, 
The interest rate, 
The borrower's income, 
The debt to income ratio, 
The number of accounts the borrower held, 
Derogatory marks against the borrower, 
The total debt.

The dataset was then separated and split into training and testing sets in order to understand the accuracy of the model.  A logistic regression model was implemented using sklearn and fit to our training data to allow us to make predictions on the loans from our lending data. After making our predictions, the model's performance was evaluated by calculating accuracy scores, as well as, generating a confusion matrix and classification report. Using this data and model, the predictions were tested on 19,384 values.
